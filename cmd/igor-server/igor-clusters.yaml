# This is an example config for a cluster named 'krypton'.
# IMPORTANT: Igor assumes that hostnames for cluster nodes are the cluster prefix followed by the hostmap index number.
# In the below example this would mean the hostname list would start with "kn1" and end with "kn12".

# The top-level param is the name of your cluster.
krypton:

  # prefix (string) - This is the 2-3 letter designator of the cluster and the first part of an individual node's hostname.
  prefix: kn

  # display-width/height (int) - These are the dimensions the igor CLI client will use when displaying the node
  # map for this cluster. The product of these two values must be >= the total number of nodes in the cluster.
  displayWidth: 6
  displayHeight: 2

  # Cluster host specification.
  hostmap:

    # hostnum: (required/int) - the sequence number and suffix of each node hostname.
    #   mac:      (required) mac address for this host
    #   hostname: (required if different from convention) Igor assumes the hostname follows the convention <prefix><seq#>
    #             ex. with cluster prefix 'kn', the host entered in position 1 has the hostname kn1, position 2 = kn2, etc.
    #             If the actual hostname is different with no alias that fulfils Igor's convention, it must be specified here.
    #   eth:      (required if using vlan segmentation) the mapping from hostname to switch reference
    #   ip:       (required) - the ip address for this host. Can be IPv4 or IPv6
    #   policy:   (requried if not 'default') Name of a host policy that should be applied to this host. Default policy is
    #             used if none specified. It is not required to provide this field when first setting up igor. Subsequent
    #             use of host policies will update your cluster configuration file with the correct policy applied to each node.
    #   bootMode: (required) options are 'bios'(legacy) or 'uefi'. Select the pxe boot system this host is configured to.
