# -- SERVER SETTINGS --
#
# Settings for connecting to the igor server.
server:

  # host (string) - hostname or IP where igor-server is running
  # REQUIRED field.
  host:

  # port (uint) - igor-server port for accepting connections from clients
  # Default: 8443
  port:

# -- CLIENT SETTINGS --
#
# These are optional settings that tweak how the client works.
client:

  # certFile/keyFile (string) - Optional paths to a cert/key file pair if you have set up igor-server to only accept
  # client connections from known installations. Self-signed certificates will work. This path must be absolute.
  # Default: (blank)
  certFile:
  keyFile:

  # caCert (string) - Optional location of CA Cert used to sign the cert and key files above. This path can be absolute
  # or relative to the client executable.
  # Default: (blank)
  caCert:

  # timezone (string) - Designates a specific timezone for this client to assist in display of reservation datetimes.
  # The default is to use the machine's tz, but if that is set to UTC or a different zone than the user a local tz may
  # be desired. Note that if the machine lacks an IANA TZ database it may not be possible for the client to use what is
  # set here. Examples: US/Pacific, America/Denver, Zulu, Japan, Europe/London
  # Default: (blank - uses client machine tz)
  timezone:

  # authLocal (true/false) - Set explicitly to false if igor's password authentication is being handled by an
  # external service such as LDAP. This will save some time for users accidentally trying to change their password
  # and have it denied in the client rather than waiting on a server denial response.
  # Default: true
  authLocal:

  # passwordLabel (string) - This is a label reminder of what kind of password igor is expecting when the user is
  # prompted for one. It prepends the provided text to " password". The default results in "igor password". If the
  # server is authenticating with LDAP a different value is advised such as "LDAP", "Kerberos" or even a  company
  # name. For example a more helpful label would be "School LDAP password".
  # This is only a convenience label. It does NOT change how the client performs authentication.
  # Default: igor
